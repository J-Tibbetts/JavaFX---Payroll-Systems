  Final Project - Java 285
  Original ReadEmployeeRecord, WriteEmployeeRecord, EmployeeRecord and EmpRec all provided
  by Prof Haley
  -Its been a great semester! The main program is in ScheduleMainUI

*/

So the enclosed java classes and interfaces culminate in my Restaurant Employee Scheduling program.
This program essentially simulates a simple database management system, allowing the user to input 
different position codes to create clock in profiles. Employees can then be entered and bounded to 
a fixed department and given a maximum job code to clock in under. These employees may also clock 
in using any lower # jobCode as well.
The user may then schedule these employees for different shifts using the clock in profile. The main
scheduling UI will display a report for a given time period and an employee roster. The menus for entering
data are a bit overly dynamic, requiring a specific entry order. I admit its not the most fluid process
but it does display plenty of eventHandlers, collections and different FX objects. Its not the most efficient system,
but hopefully it isn't too bad for someone knew java as little more than a hot caffinated beverage six
months ago.
Hopefully this fulfills the requirements of the assignment and I would love to polish this further during
the next semester!
